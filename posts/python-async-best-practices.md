# Python Async Programming Best Practices

Asynchronous programming in Python can dramatically improve your application's performance, especially for I/O-bound operations. Let's explore the best practices for writing efficient async code with asyncio.

## Understanding Async/Await

Async programming allows your code to handle multiple operations concurrently without blocking the main thread. Here's how it works:

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import time

# Synchronous version (slow)
def fetch_url_sync(url):
    import requests
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.status_code

# Asynchronous version (fast)
async def fetch_url_async(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return response.status

async def main():
    urls = [
        'https://httpbin.org/delay/1',
        'https://httpbin.org/delay/1',
        'https://httpbin.org/delay/1'
    ]
    
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        # Run all requests concurrently
        tasks = [fetch_url_async(session, url) for url in urls]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        print(f"Results: {results}")

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Best Practice #1: Use asyncio.gather() for Concurrent Operations

When you need to run multiple async operations concurrently:

```python
async def process_data_concurrently():
    # ‚ùå Sequential (slow)
    result1 = await fetch_data(1)
    result2 = await fetch_data(2)
    result3 = await fetch_data(3)
    
    # ‚úÖ Concurrent (fast)
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        fetch_data(1),
        fetch_data(2),
        fetch_data(3)
    )
    return results

async def fetch_data(item_id):
    # Simulate API call
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Data for {item_id}"
```

## Best Practice #2: Use Async Context Managers

Always use async context managers for resources:

```python
import aiofiles
import aiohttp

async def read_file_async():
    # ‚úÖ Proper async file handling
    async with aiofiles.open('large_file.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = await file.read()
        return content

async def make_http_requests():
    # ‚úÖ Proper session management
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get('https://api.example.com') as response:
            data = await response.json()
            return data
```

## Best Practice #3: Handle Exceptions Properly

Use try/except blocks with async operations:

```python
async def robust_api_call(url):
    try:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(url, timeout=5) as response:
                if response.status == 200:
                    return await response.json()
                else:
                    raise aiohttp.ClientResponseError(
                        request_info=response.request_info,
                        history=response.history,
                        status=response.status
                    )
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print(f"Timeout when calling {url}")
        return None
    except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
        print(f"HTTP error when calling {url}: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        return None
```

## Best Practice #4: Use Semaphores for Rate Limiting

Control the number of concurrent operations:

```python
async def rate_limited_requests():
    # Limit to 5 concurrent requests
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(5)
    
    async def fetch_with_semaphore(session, url):
        async with semaphore:  # Acquire semaphore
            async with session.get(url) as response:
                return await response.text()
    
    urls = [f'https://httpbin.org/delay/1' for _ in range(20)]
    
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [fetch_with_semaphore(session, url) for url in urls]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return results
```

## Best Practice #5: Use asyncio.create_task() for Fire-and-Forget

When you want to start a task but don't immediately need the result:

```python
async def background_task(name, delay):
    print(f"Starting {name}")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Completed {name}")

async def main_with_background_tasks():
    # Start background tasks
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(background_task("Task 1", 2))
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(background_task("Task 2", 3))
    
    # Do other work
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Main work done")
    
    # Wait for background tasks if needed
    await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)
```

## Best Practice #6: Proper Database Operations

Using async database libraries like `asyncpg` or `aiosqlite`:

```python
import asyncpg

async def database_operations():
    # Connection pooling for better performance
    pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
        "postgresql://user:password@localhost/database",
        min_size=10,
        max_size=20
    )
    
    try:
        async with pool.acquire() as connection:
            # Use transactions for data consistency
            async with connection.transaction():
                await connection.execute(
                    "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2)",
                    "John Doe", "john@example.com"
                )
                
                users = await connection.fetch(
                    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1",
                    "john@example.com"
                )
                return users
    finally:
        await pool.close()
```

## Best Practice #7: Use Queue for Producer-Consumer Patterns

```python
import asyncio
import random

async def producer(queue, name):
    for i in range(5):
        # Simulate work
        await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 0.5))
        item = f"{name}-item-{i}"
        await queue.put(item)
        print(f"Produced: {item}")
    
    # Signal completion
    await queue.put(None)

async def consumer(queue, name):
    while True:
        item = await queue.get()
        if item is None:
            # Put sentinel back for other consumers
            await queue.put(None)
            break
        
        # Process item
        await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 0.3))
        print(f"{name} consumed: {item}")
        queue.task_done()

async def producer_consumer_example():
    queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=10)
    
    # Start producer and consumers
    await asyncio.gather(
        producer(queue, "Producer"),
        consumer(queue, "Consumer-1"),
        consumer(queue, "Consumer-2")
    )
```

## Performance Tips

### 1. Use asyncio.run() for Top-Level

```python
# ‚úÖ Correct way to run async code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### 2. Avoid Blocking Operations

```python
# ‚ùå Don't do this (blocks event loop)
async def bad_example():
    time.sleep(1)  # Blocks!
    return "done"

# ‚úÖ Use async sleep instead
async def good_example():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Non-blocking
    return "done"
```

### 3. Use Connection Pooling

```python
# ‚úÖ Reuse connections
class APIClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.session = None
    
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession(
            connector=aiohttp.TCPConnector(limit=100)
        )
        return self
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        await self.session.close()
    
    async def get(self, url):
        async with self.session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.json()

# Usage
async with APIClient() as client:
    data1 = await client.get('https://api1.com')
    data2 = await client.get('https://api2.com')
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Forgetting to await

```python
# ‚ùå Wrong - creates coroutine but doesn't run it
async def wrong():
    fetch_data()  # This doesn't run!

# ‚úÖ Correct
async def correct():
    await fetch_data()
```

### 2. Using blocking I/O in async functions

```python
# ‚ùå Wrong - blocks event loop
async def wrong():
    with open('file.txt') as f:
        return f.read()

# ‚úÖ Correct - non-blocking
async def correct():
    async with aiofiles.open('file.txt') as f:
        return await f.read()
```

## Testing Async Code

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
async def async_client():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        yield session

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_function(async_client):
    result = await my_async_function(async_client)
    assert result is not None
```
